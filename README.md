Biodiversity in National Parks: Analysis and Conservation Insights
Welcome to the Biodiversity in National Parks project repository! This project aims to analyze data from the National Parks Service to uncover insights about species observations and conservation statuses within various national parks.

Project Overview:
In this project, we delve into the rich biodiversity of national parks by merging and analyzing datasets containing species information and park-specific observations. Our goal is to identify patterns, highlight critical conservation needs, and provide actionable recommendations for preserving our natural heritage.

Key Objectives:
Data Analysis: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of species observations and conservation statuses.
Insight Generation: Uncover patterns and trends related to biodiversity in national parks.
Visualization: Create visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations for conservation efforts.
Datasets
species_info.csv: Contains information about species, including scientific names, common names, categories, and conservation statuses.
parks_info.csv: Contains information about parks, including park names and species observations.

Analysis Highlights:
Parks with the Highest Number of Species Observations: Identified key parks that are biodiversity hotspots and should be prioritized for conservation efforts.
Categories of Species with the Most Observations: Highlighted which species categories are most observed and their ecological importance.
Conservation Status Distribution: Analyzed the distribution of conservation statuses to understand the risks faced by different species.
Likelihood of Endangerment by Category: Identified species categories more likely to be endangered, informing targeted conservation strategies.

Repository Contents:
Data/: Contains the datasets used for analysis.
Notebooks/: Jupyter Notebooks with detailed analysis and visualizations.
Plots/: Generated plots and charts illustrating key findings.
README.md: Project overview and instructions.

Future Work:
Longitudinal Studies: Track changes in species populations and conservation statuses over time.
Enhanced Data Collection: Improve data collection methods for more accurate and granular analyses.
Collaborative Efforts: Foster collaboration between researchers, conservationists, and park authorities.
